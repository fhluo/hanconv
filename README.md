## Introduction

Hanconv converts between Chinese characters variants base on [OpenCC](https://github.com/BYVoid/OpenCC)'s dictionaries
and conversion rules. It provides efficient conversion between Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese both as a
command-line tool and as a library for integration into other projects.

## Installation

### Using Cargo

```shell
cargo install hanconv
```

- **Convert a text file from Simplified to Traditional Chinese:**

    ```shell
    hanconv s2t -i input.txt -o output.txt
    ```

- **Convert a text file from Traditional to Simplified Chinese:**

    ```shell
    hanconv t2s -i input.txt -o output.txt
    ```

    hanconv t2s -i input.txt -o output.txt --encoding GBK
    ```
